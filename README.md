# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is akin to a digital "emotion detective" for spoken words.  It listens to a person's speech and attempts to discern their emotional state, whether it's happiness, sadness, anger, or another emotion.  SER achieves this by scrutinizing various elements of the voice, including pitch, tone, and rhythm.
